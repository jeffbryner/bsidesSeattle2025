| Successful Administrator Privilege Gain        | 3     |
| Successful User Privilege Gain                 | 1     |
| Attempted Denial of Service                    | 3     |
| Not Suspicious Traffic                         | 1     |

### 2. Key Findings and Patterns

*   **High Volume of Policy Violations:** A significant number of alerts fall under "Potential Corporate Privacy Violation." This suggests a need to review and potentially tighten internal security policies regarding software usage (AOL Toolbar, TeamViewer), outbound data (cleartext passwords, IP address lookups), and browsing habits (adult sites).
*   **SMB-Related Alerts:** Several alerts involve SMB (Server Message Block) protocol activity, including file transfers, remote scheduled job creation, and PowerShell activity. This is often indicative of lateral movement attempts by attackers. The presence of ETERNALBLUE exploits is also a major concern.
*   **Exploit Attempts:** A variety of exploit attempts are detected, targeting vulnerabilities in web servers (ColdFusion, Drupal, Struts), network devices (Netgear, Linksys), and Windows systems (MS08-067).  While most attempts appear unsuccessful, the volume indicates a need for proactive vulnerability management.
*   **Scanning Activity:** The presence of "ET SCAN" alerts, including potential SSH scans and unusual port traffic, suggests that the network is being actively probed for vulnerabilities. The "Outgoing Masscan detected" alerts indicate a compromised host performing internal scans.
*   **Tor Usage:** Multiple alerts related to TOR exit nodes and relay traffic. Investigate allowed traffic on port 443 by internal IPs to any TOR IP.
*  **Generic Protocol Command Decode Alerts:** These alerts indicate anomalies in network protocol behavior, potentially indicating crafted attacks, misconfigurations, or unusual network traffic. A deeper investigation of the affected services is warranted.

### 3. Recommended Actions for the SOC Team

1.  **Prioritize and Investigate Exploit Attempts:** Focus on alerts related to "Attempted Administrator Privilege Gain," "Attempted User Privilege Gain" and "Successful Administrator Privilege Gain" categories. Investigate source and destination IPs, assess the potential impact, and determine if the attempts were successful.
2.  **Address SMB-Related Risks:**
    *   **Patch Systems:** Ensure that all Windows systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches, especially those addressing the MS17-010 (ETERNALBLUE) vulnerability.
    *   **Restrict SMB Access:** Review and restrict SMB access to only necessary systems and users. Implement network segmentation to limit the potential impact of lateral movement.
    *   **Monitor SMB Traffic:** Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for SMB traffic, focusing on unusual file transfers, PowerShell activity, and remote command execution attempts.
3.  **Review and Enforce Security Policies:**
    *   **Software Usage:**  Review and enforce policies regarding the use of potentially unwanted software (PUA/adware), outdated software (Flash), and unauthorized remote access tools (TeamViewer).
    *   **Outbound Data:** Implement measures to prevent the transmission of sensitive data in cleartext (e.g., passwords) and restrict access to potentially privacy-violating services (e.g., IP address lookups).
    *  **DNS Queries for malicious TLD:** Review and investigate allowed DNS traffic to potentially malicious TLDs.
4.  **Improve Vulnerability Management:**
    *   **Regular Scanning:** Implement regular vulnerability scanning to identify and remediate security weaknesses in systems and applications.
    *   **Patch Management:** Establish a robust patch management process to ensure that systems are promptly updated with security patches.
5.  **Investigate Scanning Activity:**
    *   **Identify Sources:** Determine the source of the scanning activity (internal or external) and take appropriate action.
    *   **Harden Systems:**  Harden systems to reduce their attack surface and make them less vulnerable to scanning.
6.  **Analyze Protocol Decode Errors:** Examine the Suricata alerts related to protocol decode errors. These alerts might indicate misconfigured protocols or malicious traffic attempting to evade detection. Capture and analyze the affected traffic for further inspection.
7.  **Investigate TOR traffic:** Examine the Suricata alerts related to TOR traffic for further analysis. These alerts might indicate malicious traffic that need to be investigated.
8.  **Review Alert Suppression:** If any of these alerts are being suppressed, reassess the suppression rules to ensure they are still valid and not masking malicious activity.
9.  **Correlate Events:**  Correlate these alerts with other security events and logs to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the overall security posture of the network.

By addressing these recommendations, you can significantly improve your organization's security posture and reduce the risk of successful attacks.
